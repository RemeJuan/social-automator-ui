# social-automator-ui
A small and simple UI to accompany [social-ui-automator](https://github.com/RemeJuan/social-automator).

You can view a demo [HERE](http://social-automator-ui-demo.surge.sh/).

## Instructions
From the command line:
`git clone git@github.com:RemeJuan/social-automator-ui.git`.

`npm i` to install all dependencies.
